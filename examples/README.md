# Examples

Here we have several examples, valid and invalid, for both of alloy and railML instances.

On the **alloy** directory we have examples of alloy instances (correct and some rule negation) and on the **railml** directory, we have the same kind of examples translated with our [tool](https://github.com/pedrordgs/RailML-Utilities/tree/master/alloy_related/alloyToRailML).
